# 🧵 Feature Detection, Matching, and RANSAC for Image Stitching (Panorama Creation)

This project demonstrates how to stitch two overlapping images to form a **panorama** using computer vision techniques such as **SIFT**, **Brute Force Matcher**, and **Computing Homography using RANSAC**.

Whether you're using OpenCV's built-in SIFT or implementing your own version, this notebook helps you understand how panorama creation works under the hood.

## 🎯 Goal of the Project

To:
- Detect and describe features in both images.
- Match features using descriptors.
- Estimate a homography matrix using RANSAC.
- Warp one image onto another.
- Create a stitched panorama.
